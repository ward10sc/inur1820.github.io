<p>So after a few months of being somewhere between open and closed beta, we have no updates on the release date for Dota 2. The community has been growing extensively, with probably more than 50-60.000 people currently in it and the game is ever-expanding. </p>

<p><b>Forums - General Discussion - DOTABUFF - Dota 2 Stats.</b> This update won't be as much as most of the players went through during the closed beta days, last 2011. Either way, we can just wait for it. They mentioned, "early" next week, assuming it won't be Valve time, the part two update (custom games) will be announced some time between Monday~Wednesday. Artifact, the Dota 2 digital card-collecting game, is still on target for its launch date at the end of November, but its planned beta period is going to be shorter. <b>Valve Announces Dota 2 Reborn Beta with New Engine, New Interface.</b> <b>Dota 2 card game Artifact’s beta quietly delayed.</b> </p>
