A 44/16 gear ratio, also sometimes written as a ratio of 2.75, allows for easier acceleration, but has lower top speeds and is generally more suited for leisurely. Spreadsheet with gear ratios/speeds/cadence? A couple of days ago in a thread I was reading, there was a spreadsheet extract someone had posted. It had front ring sizes, rear cogs, gear inches, speeds and their required cadences. Historically, bikes were fixed gear, meaning one revolution of the pedals was equal to one revolution of the back wheel, for a 1:1 ratio. With a train drive, however, a single turn of the chainring can produce multiple revolutions of the rear sprocket and wheel. </p>

On some bicycles, there is only one gear and the gear ratio is fixed.Many contemporary bicycles have multiple gears and thus multiple gear ratios. Graphical gear calculator for bicycle gearing systems. Includes derailleur gears and internal gear hubs. Grafischer Ritzelrechner zur Berechnung der Entfaltung von Fahrradschaltungen. <b>Bike gears: shifting explained for beginners - Cycling Weekly.</b> <b>Bicycle Gear Ratio Comparison Calculator - YouTube.</b> A certain gear ratio, on the same drivetrain, can be achieved with various chainring combinations. Let us take for an example a drivetrain with front chainrings 48-38-28 combination, and a 6 speed 14-16-19-21-24-28 cassette. The exact same gear ratio can be achieved with a 48-24 combination, as well as with 28-14. <b>Bike Gear Ratio Chart - I Love Bicycling.</b> Colors group similar values. 80+ is green, 50ish-80, blue, and below D is the gear inches of your highest gear.

This helps you calculate gear inches, development from your gear ratio and wheel size, and then helps you calculate your cadence given a certain speed and gear ratio and viceversa. A bike with 30 or more gears is not an indication of a machine designed to break the land speed record any more than a bike with only a single gear, assuming similar ratios. Lots of bike gears. For example, using a high gear ratio such as 53 x 12T is equivalent to riding a penny-farthing with a front wheel that is nearly 10 feet (or 3m) tall. In contrast, a low gear ratio <b>Gear Ratios: How to Select Touring Bike Gearing.</b> <b>Bicycle Gear Ratios - How Bicycles Work HowStuffWorks.</b> Gear Ratio s Speed Spreadsheet This spreadsheet (picture in the attached PDF file) has been popular with my cycling friends.

You ll need Excel to use it, though. This allows you to see fairly complete information about chainring and cog choices, and the effects of the ratios. The highest gear ratio on the bike might be a front chain wheel with 44 teeth and a rear gear having 11 teeth. That creates a 4-to-1 gear ratio. With 26-inch wheels, the bike moves forward 326 inches with each pedal stroke. At a 60-rpm pedaling rate, the speed </p>
