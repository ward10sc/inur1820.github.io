<p><b>EXAMPLE OF USE OF QUOTIENT OF POWERS.docx.</b> <b>Multiply divide powers (integer exponents) - Khan Academy.</b> In calculus, the quotient rule of derivatives is a method of finding the derivative of a function that is the division of two other functions for which derivatives exist. The quotient rule in integration follows from it. The rule itself is a direct consequence of differentiation. </p>

<p>When raising a power to a power in an exponential expression, you find the new power by multiplying the two powers together. For example, in the following expression, x to the power of 3 is being raised to the power of 6, and so you would multiply 3 and 6 to find the new power. In all its glory. Differentiating powers of x If y=x^n then dy/dx = nx^n-1. This result is derived in this unit and illustrated with several examples, including cases where. <b>Simplify an Algebraic Term Involving Exponents and/or Powers.</b> Division, powers of the same base, simplify, power law For this case we have an expression formed by a division of powers of the same base in which we must apply a law to simplify said expression. By definition we have the property of the power quotient of the same base set: Then, according to the stated property we have:. This is an example of the quotient of powers property and tells us that when you divide powers with the same base you just have to subtract the exponents. $$ frac{x^{a}}{x^{b}}=x^{a-b}, : : x neq 0$$ When you raise a quotient to a power you raise both the numerator and the denominator to the power. <b>Power Of A Quotient: Property Rule - Video Lesson.</b> <b>A Review of the Rules for Exponents - Mesa Community College.</b> <b>Differentiating Powers of X - Maths Tutor.</b> The quotient rule is one of the exponent rules that makes it easy to divide two exponents, or powers, with the same base.

<p><b>Quotient Rule for Exponents Sciencing.</b> Quotient Rule: , this says that to divide two exponents with the same base, you keep the base and subtract the powers. This is similar to reducing fractions; Part II asks students to compare the exponents of the quotient with those of the dividend and divisor powers. Ask a student to write a general rule from this pattern, using variables. Have a student share the rule they came up with and write this rule on the board.
