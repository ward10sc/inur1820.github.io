K-Meleon Review A very fast Gecko-based browser built on Mozilla Firefox code A review of K-Meleon by Tina de Pierre. K-Meleon is a free web browser that is based on the Gecko engine, the same one used by Mozilla Firefox. That being said, K-Meleon is the fastest browser I have found yet.

Excellent work, K-Meleon devs. I highly reccomend this browser. </p>

<p><b>Is The K-Meleon Browser Really Lightweight.</b> K-Meleon Reviews. J. (Windows 10 cannot be installed), I tried some browsers. K-meleon was by far the fastest I tried. Faster than Opera, Firefox, Slimjet. Lightest browser that still works with modern web, WIN 2000 looking User interface, for very dated hardware. So, instead of discovering the fastest web browser (or even a fast web browser), I discovered the slowest web browser of all. When you re the creator of a web browser, that isn t exactly a title you want to lay claim to. With that said, for some people speed isn t really everything when it comes to web browsing. <b>K-Meleon 74 Beta 4 Web browsers - Downloadsource.net.</b> <b>Download K-Meleon 75.1 - FileHippo.com.</b> </p>
